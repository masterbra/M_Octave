%% @defun defaultpython ()
%% A string to execute to call a Python interpreter.
%%
%% Distributors/vendors may find this a convenient place to change
%% the default python executable, e.g., to specify "python3.8" or to
%% hardcode a path to a particular executable.
%%
%% End-users can always override this by setting the environment
%% variable @code{PYTHON} as documented in @pxref{sympref}.

%% @end defun

function python = defaultpython ()

  python = 'py27.exe';
